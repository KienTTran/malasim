# Clinical Trials

This module implements clinical trial simulations and study-related events in the malaria simulation system.

## Overview

The Clinical Trials module provides:
- Clinical study simulations
- Trial event management
- Outcome tracking
- Data collection
- Analysis support

## Components

### Clinical Study
- `ClinicalStudy`: Core trial implementation
  - Study protocol management
  - Patient enrollment
  - Treatment assignment
  - Outcome tracking
  - Data collection

## Key Features

### Trial Management
- Protocol implementation
- Patient recruitment
- Treatment allocation
- Follow-up scheduling
- Outcome assessment

### Data Collection
- Clinical outcomes
- Treatment responses
- Adverse events
- Patient compliance
- Study metrics

## Implementation

### Study Structure
```cpp
class ClinicalStudy {
    // Study management
    void enroll_patient();
    void assign_treatment();
    void track_outcomes();
    
    // Data collection
    void record_data();
    void analyze_results();
};
```

## Usage

```cpp
// Initialize study
auto study = new ClinicalStudy(protocol_config);

// Manage patients
study->enroll_patient(patient);
study->assign_treatment(patient, treatment);

// Track outcomes
study->track_outcomes(patient);
study->record_data();
```

## Key Algorithms

### Trial Design
- Randomization
- Treatment allocation
- Follow-up scheduling
- Outcome assessment
- Data analysis

### Outcome Tracking
- Clinical response
- Treatment efficacy
- Safety monitoring
- Protocol adherence
- Study completion

## Dependencies

- Core components:
  - `Event`
  - `Model`
  - `Population`
- Clinical components:
  - `Treatment`
  - `Patient`
  - `Outcomes`

## Notes

- Protocol adherence is crucial
- Data quality is essential
- Regular monitoring needed
- Safety is priority
- Documentation required
- Analysis plan needed
- Ethics considerations
- Regulatory compliance
